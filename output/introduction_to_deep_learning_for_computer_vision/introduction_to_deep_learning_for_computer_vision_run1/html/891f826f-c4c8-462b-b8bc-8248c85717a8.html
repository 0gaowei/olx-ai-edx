<p><h2>Using CNNs for Feature Extraction</h2><p>CNNs are used to extract features from images that can be used as input for the language model. Learn about popular CNN architectures for feature extraction. Visual aids explain the convolutional process and feature mapping, demonstrating how CNNs capture spatial hierarchies in images.</p></p>
